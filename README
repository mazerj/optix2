NOTE: dtp92 required 'apt-get install libusb-dev' for usb.h!

The programs in this directory are for gamma correcting LCD
and CRT monitors using the DTP94 usb calibration bug from
the MonacoOptix guys.

User steps are pretty simple:

1. plug DTP94 into USB port on the rig machine to calibrate
2. run the 'gammacal' program (should be in /auto/share/pypeextra
   on your path:
	% gammacal ConfigFile lcd|crt [gamma_value] >outfile
   ConfigFile is the name of the pyperc Config.HOST file for
   the system you want to calibrate, lcd|crt is either 'lcd' or
   'crt', depending on what you're calibrating and gamma_value
   is an optional gamma value to set the monitor to DURING the
   calibration for validating and existing calibration

   Calibration data is saved to 'outfile', keep this -- it's
   a record of the complete luminance and color calibration
   for the monitor.
4. Plot the resulting calibration:
	% matlab
	...
	>> showcalib('outfile');

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation steps are slightly more complicated. If you're running
ubuntu, then just run (in this directory):
	% make ubuntu
	% make clean
If you're running Fedora
	% make fedora
	% make clean

Some of the installation depends on sudo, so you might get asked
for your password..

--------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES: 
  - Should be no need to run calibrations as root, since dtp94 should
    get installed suid-root.
  - the dtp94 and pypenv calibration programs now stay in this directory
    and the gammacal script knows how to find them..
